# Fix DB and Async Errors - 2025-07-16

## 1. Problem Description

The application had multiple compilation errors across `roles.rs`, `service.rs`, and `mod.rs` within the AI API. The errors included:
- `cannot find function` for database operations in `roles.rs`.
- `no method named 'map_err' found for opaque type 'impl Future<...>'` due to missing `.await` calls in `async` functions.
- `future cannot be sent between threads safely` due to `MutexGuard` living across an `.await` point.
- Lifetime errors where a borrowed value did not live long enough.

## 2. Solution

I addressed these issues by making the following changes:

### In `src-tauri/src/api/ai/service.rs`:
- Added `.await` to all asynchronous database calls (`db::get_setting` and `db::save_setting`). This resolved the 'no method named map_err' errors.

### In `src-tauri/src/api/ai/mod.rs`:
- Refactored the `summarize_clipboard_entries` function to ensure the `MutexGuard` (`conn_guard`) lives long enough for the entire asynchronous database query and result processing to complete. This fixed the lifetime error.
- Previously fixed the `list_custom_model_configs` to resolve a similar thread safety issue.

### In `src-tauri/src/api/ai/roles.rs`:
- Added `.await` to all database function calls.
- Attempted to fix the incorrect database function names by guessing the correct ones (`list_roles`, `delete_role`). However, without access to `db.rs`, some function names might still be incorrect.

## 3. Current Status

All compilation errors in `service.rs` and `mod.rs` have been resolved. The primary remaining issue is the incorrect function name for deleting a role in `roles.rs`.

To fully resolve the issue, the correct function signatures from `src-tauri/src/db.rs` for role management are needed.

The task is now partially complete. The main blockers have been removed.
